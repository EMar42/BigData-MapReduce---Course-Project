  <h3 align="center">MapReduce BigData-Course-FinalProject</h3>
  <p align="center">
   During an academic course called: "Big Data", We were required to perform a simple MapReduce from big data collection, calculating the amount of precipitation each month based on an XLS file with the data to process over the years 1900-2018. Instead of using a simple python MapReduce library, I choose to use Kubernetes of azure, using two separate pods for running MapReduce based on Hadoop for getting more efficiency for the "Big Data" information scale.</p>
